US House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan has called on European Union antitrust chief Teresa Ribera to clarify how the EU enforces its Digital Markets Act (DMA), which he believes disproportionately targets American companies. His request follows a memorandum signed by US President Donald Trump, warning that the administration would scrutinise the EU’s new rules regulating how US companies interact with consumers in Europe.

Jordan and his co-signatory, Scott Fitzgerald, criticised the DMA’s hefty fines, which can reach up to 10% of a company’s global revenue for violations. They argue that the rules not only disadvantage US companies but also potentially benefit Chinese firms, stifling innovation and handing over valuable data to adversarial nations. The letter urges Ribera to address these concerns with the judiciary committee by March 10.

The European Commission, where Ribera is the second-highest official, has rejected claims that its laws are aimed at American companies. Ribera defended the DMA in a recent interview, stating that the EU should not be pressured into altering laws that have already been approved by European lawmakers.
